### Run strategies live on Binance from __Live_Bot.py__
---
__Run strategies at your own risk I am not responsible for your trading decisions, futures are risky and proper risk management should be adhered to at all times, always have a stoploss__
---
__There is no set strategy, You can select one by uncommenting it in make_Decision() inside Bot_Class.py , These Strategies are from Trading_Strats.py and should be backtested thoroughly/ Altered to make more profitable__
* Settings are in __Config_File.py__
* Trade a single position at a time by setting __Max_Margin = 0__, to trade multiple coins just change this value to suit your desired Max Margin for your positions i.e. __Max_Margin = .15__ will allow the bot to open positions until you have used up 15% of your account as margin.
* Choose the Interval you want to trade and the buffer of candlesticks your strategy will need this will be dependent on indicators you need to ensure you have a sufficient buffer, or you will get errors.
* Leverage and order_size should be changed according to your preference
* symbol[] is a list of the symbols you wish to trade, the default is all the coins on the exchange currently.
* __Trailing stop: set __use_trailing_stop__ to __1__ and change __trailing_stop_percent__ to suit your strategy to use the trailing stop (Min val .001 i.e .1%, Max 5 i.e. 5%). The trailing stop will be placed when the takeprofitval margin of increase/decrease is reached from your strategy__.
---
#### Creating Custom Strategies:
__Strategies are implemented in Bot_Class.py as a function named Make_decision() in the Bot class__
* Make_decision() must return Trade_Direction,stop_loss_val,take_profit_val for the strategy to work properly
* You might draw inspiration for a strategy from one in __TradingStrats.py__
* I recommend using the backtester first.

### Back test strategies in [Backtester.py](https://github.com/conor19w/Binance-Futures-Trading-Bot/blob/main/Backtester.py)
---
* Create a 'price_data' folder on the desktop and change the path variable in Helper.py to suit your machine. Data pulled from Binance will be stored in this folder and automatically loaded from memory in future.
* Create a list named 'symbol' of coin/coins you wish to run a strategy on ie. symbol = ['BTCUSDT' , 'ETHUSDT'] , this would run your strategy on BTC and ETH.
Whereas symbol = ['BTCUSDT'] would run the strategy on BTC only.
* Settings are found at the top of the script, __line 44__.
* Trailing Stop (NOT FUNCTIONING CORRECTLY): turn the __use_trailing_stop__ flag on, specify the __trailing_stop_distance__ in decimal, now when a takeprofit margin target is hit the trailing stop will be placed and automatically & adjusted based off new Lows or Highs in price and the __trailing_stop_distance__ you've specified.
* Next we want to choose our TA strategy, this is done after __line 175__ , uncomment a strategy or call a new strategy you have written yourself here, the 'Trade_Direction' variable is used to tell the script to go short (0), go long (1), or go flat (-99). This should be returned by custom strategy functions/classes you write for the strategy to be executed correctly
* Now just run the script and wait a few minutes for it to pull the data and begin backtesting
* Heikin Ashi Candles are available under: CloseStream_H, OpenStream_H, LowStream_H, HighStream_H which can be referenced or passed to Strategies.
---
### __Back Test top performers:__
---
__Not indicative of future returns__
* Check out the other backtests although results were poor on some that was due to transaction fees in many cases so maybe altering to take less trades or add confirmation could work.
* All of the strategies can be improved on but this is just a good place to start.
* Try removing some coins from the list traded, the tests below were on all coins available at the time.

## To-Do list: (suggest something and I'll add it) ðŸ˜ƒ
* Add option to create csv file of trades with keys: "long/short | date | strike price | candle high | candle low". 
* Fix trailing Stop in Back Tester, think its causing some rounding errors.
* GUI if people were interested (could take a while I've no experience here)

## Latest Changes (if any):
* Added Functionality for opening and managing multiple positions. (20/03/22)
* Simplified the system to be more user friendly, removed code that was obsolete. (11/03/22)
* Added support in the live Bot environment for some of the strategies in Trading_strats.py , To make use of a strategy in Bot.py just uncomment it inside Make_Decision() inside Data_set.py (11/02/2022).
* Added support for Heikin Ashi candles in Bot.py, there is now a switch in settings use_heikin_ashi. If switched on you may reference self.Open_H, self.Close_H etc. from make_Decision() in Data_set.py (17/01/22).
* Updated Backtester to make it more user friendly & changed naming convention for saved data (14/01/22).
* At the end of a backtest you can see the date & time that every trade was taken. So you can debug strategies by checking on tradingview/binance (07/01/22).
